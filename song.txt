Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
So I gotta stay high, yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my

Wockhardt in my body, I can't help myself, uh
I get so damn high that I can't feel myself
My girlfriend worried about me, think I'm gon' kill myself
Sorry, baby, I'm just really tryna feel myself
Keep my head above the water while I drown in wealth
I got that drip like Gunna, I might drip or drown myself
You know I love choppers, I had to surround myself
Takin' Gelato to the head, smoked the pound myself

YEE
